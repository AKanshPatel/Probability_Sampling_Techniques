# Probability_Sampling_Techniques
## Sampling Techniques with Python: 
This repository provides a **hands-on demonstration** of probability sampling techniques using Python. It explains **how to select representative subsets** from a population dataset and **visualize their distributions.**

## ðŸ“Œ Features: 
* Generates a **synthetic dataset **based on **normal distribution **(for numeric data) and **probability-based generation **(for categorical data).
* Implements and explains four probability sampling techniques:
  * **Simple Random Sampling**
  * **Systematic Sampling**
  * **Stratified Sampling**
  * **Cluster Sampling**
* **Visualizes** population vs. sample distributions for better understanding.
* Provides **Python code** examples for each method.

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases : 
* Learning and teaching probability sampling methods.
* Understanding dataset representativeness in data science projects.
* Preparing material for statistics, ML, or research applications.

## ðŸ“Œ Inferences : 
From the visualizations and sampling demonstrations, we can infer:
* **Simple Random Sampling:** Provides **unbiased samples** but may not always capture subgroup proportions.
* **Systematic Sampling:** **Easy to implement**, but can **introduce bias** if the population has a hidden pattern.
* **Stratified Sampling:** Ensures representation of all subgroups (strata), making it **highly reliable when population has diverse categories.**
* **Cluster Sampling:** **Cost-efficient for large populations,** though it may reduce accuracy compared to stratified sampling.
The **histograms** show that while all methods approximate the population distribution, stratified sampling most closely aligns with population proportions, especially for categorical data.
